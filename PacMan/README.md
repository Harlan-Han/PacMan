## Description of the Functionality of the Game 
PAC-MAN is a classic arcade game, where a pac-man moves through a maze consuming the dots and avoiding the coloured ghosts. The player has 3 lives and loses one whenever a ghost catches them. The player gets points for eating the dots, foods, power pellets (these give special powers to pac-man) and ghosts.

Movement: Pac-man will always move in the direction that he is pointed. He cannot speed up or slow down and when the game starts, he will begin moving. In the maze pac-man can only turn a direction when the way is open, he cannot turn towards a wall. The only buttons used in this game are the directional arrows. 
In the game there is the following: (1) A maze that pac man must move through (2) Dots that pac-man must eat (3) Four power pellets, that make pacman invincible for a short amount of time during which he can eat the ghosts (they come back to life a short time later) (4) Fruit that randomly appears for a short amount of time and can be eaten for extra points (5) Four Ghosts (6) One Pac-man

> When the pacman eat all dots and power pellets, the level will plus and the maze will be updated;
